    "\n",
    "- 4-year lag between population/income (2021) and cultural venues (2025) is acceptable due to low demographic variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Disposable income better reflects actual living standards because it accounts for taxes and social transfers, making it more relevant for socio-economic comparisons at the IRIS level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In FiLoSoFi, the poverty threshold is set at 60% of the metropolitan median standard of living.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data cover IRIS areas for municipalities with at least 5,000 inhabitants in metropolitan France, Martinique, and Réunion. Up to the 2019 vintage, the data covered IRIS areas for municipalities with 10,000 inhabitants or more. The indicators are subject to statistical confidentiality rules to protect data privacy. The proposed indicators are non-additive (they cannot be aggregated by summation). The 2021 data are provided using the geography in force on 1 January 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also, observations on situation or changes in income or poverty at the local level should be interpreted with caution."
